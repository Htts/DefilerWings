----Hints---
Magic is a very important stat when picking a dragon. It allows you to breed better minions, buff yourself up for difficult fights, and access many locations.

Fear can make weak enemies run from battle or give tribute to avoid it, but it is useless against more challenging opponents.

Walking away from an encounter to pick a better one does not waste an action point, but it does increase rage. When too enraged, the dragon will charge into every encounter.

Wounds require extra turns of sleeping to heal, but the witch can heal them instantly.

Devour maidens to increase lust and reduce rage.

The services on the Smuggler's island are cheap and invaluable. 

Wings give an extra action point at the start of each turn.


------------ WALKTHROUGH---------------
1. Do not attack the Mistress in your first game

2. You must complete quests to level-up your dragon (actualy a new, more powerful flock of dragons will born, and you will choose one to play further)

3. Quest time is limited! (from 5 to 100 years to complete, depending on the quest diffculty)

4. To get your quest reward, go to the Mistress. If there is no such option - quest is not completed yet. Completed quests are automatically rewarded when the time expires.

1. First quest is easy - just do something bad. You can raze a lonley farmstead for example

2. Second quest rquires you to produce offspring. You can easily catch some peasant-girls by prowling around the rural area. Impregnate as many of them as possible (free them afterwards, do not take girls to your starting lair). Go to sleep. There is a chance of death for impregnated girl, you need at least one to survive and birth a baby-snake.

3. For the third quest you need to raise kingdom mobilisation then drop it down. It can be done in many ways, but here is the simpliest. Raze the small village to get infamy and treasure. When infamity goes to 1 - go to sleep, you should recive a message about raising mobilization in the free kingdoms. On the next year go to smuglers den on the island. Sell all treasures. You will need 100 fr. Loot and sell more if neded. Choose the option "finance the terror" in the smugglers den. Get your reward.

4. To get a reward level lair in the next quest you need to: 1) get non generic lair 2) hire mercenaries in the smuggler den 3) hire the gremlins in the gremlin village 4) install the fortifications and traps through the gremlin village options. To get a non generic lair just find a manor on the road. Or the other castle you can siege. Then rob it. The "places" button wil appear on the side panel in map screen. Get to the place and make lair there.

5. For the next quest just have a considerable infamy and wait for a knight to kill

6. You will recive more quests, until the 13th generation dragon.

7. 13th quest will be the last - get your Army of Darkness and conquer the Free Kingdoms. 

8. ...

9. PROFIT!!!


Please enjoy the game!
